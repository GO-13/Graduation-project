# Graduation project - AI Research Engineer

**_March 2020 â€“ April 2021_**

Research collaboration between Esprit-Tech and Department of Systems and Computer Engineering (SCE) at Carleton University in Canada about AI for wireless communications and networks.

* Provided engineering & scientific insight to build an AI system that uses multi-UAV to efficiently collect data from IoT networks using meta-heuristics and deep reinforcement learning.
* Developed algorithms, systems and models to optimize UAV-based offline and online data collection methods while maximizing the UAVs' energy efficiency and the volume of data collected, subject to communication, UAVs mission time and battery capacity constraints.
* Co-authored conference and journal articles.

**Keywords:** Research | Python | Clustering | Optimization | Heuristics | Deep reinforcement learning | PyTorch
